# Research: Agent Manager as a Service

*Research completed: February 12, 2026*

## Executive Summary

The market for managed AI agent services is emerging rapidly, with traditional MSPs evolving into "Managed Intelligence Providers" (MIPs). For SMBs (10-50 employees), there's a significant gap between enterprise-grade offerings (like OpenAI Frontier at $200/mo per user) and DIY approaches. This creates a compelling opportunity for a service-based business model: **"I manage your agents for you."**

---

## 1. The Market Landscape

### Existing Managed AI Agent Services

**Enterprise-Focused Players:**
- **OpenAI Operator/ChatGPT Agent** - $200/mo Pro tier, 400 messages/month; enterprise pricing via sales
- **Microsoft Copilot** - $25-30/seat/month, requires M365 ecosystem
- **Salesforce Agentforce 360** - Enterprise pricing, CRM-integrated
- **AWS AI Services** - Pay-as-you-go, but requires technical implementation

**SMB-Focused Services:**
- **Teal Tech** - "Managed Intelligence Services" for SMBs; full-lifecycle AI agent management
- **Custom Information Services** - MSP adding "Managed AI" as service tier
- **MIPGlobal.ai** - New company specifically targeting SMB/midmarket as MIP; white-labeling for other MSPs
- **Dialzara** - AI phone answering, claims 90% staffing cost savings

**Key Observation:** Most offerings are either:
1. Enterprise SaaS products requiring in-house expertise to deploy
2. Point solutions (chatbots, phone agents) rather than comprehensive management
3. Traditional MSPs adding AI as an afterthought

**The Gap:** No dominant player offering full-service "Agent Operations" for 10-50 person companies.

## 2. What SMBs Need (vs Enterprise)

### Top Barriers to AI Adoption (SMBs)

| Barrier | Prevalence | Implication |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Knowledge/Expertise Gaps** | 51% of leaders lack understanding | Need trusted advisor, not another tool |
| **Data Privacy/Security Concerns** | 59% cite as top concern | Need governance + compliance baked in |
| **Cost/ROI Uncertainty** | 50%+ cite upfront cost concerns | Need outcome-based pricing or low entry |
| **No In-House AI Expertise** | 50% lack internal skills | Need fully managed service |
| **Accuracy/Reliability Concerns** | ~50% worried about AI quality | Need oversight + human-in-loop guarantee |

### SMB vs Enterprise Needs

| Need | Enterprise | SMB (10-50 employees) |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| **Budget** | $50K-500K+ projects | $2K-10K/month max |
| **Technical Staff** | Dedicated AI/ML team | Zero to one "tech-savvy" person |
| **Governance** | Internal compliance team | Outsource completely |
| **Time to Value** | Months acceptable | Weeks required |
| **Support Model** | Ticket-based, SLA-driven | Relationship-based, responsive |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Can absorb failures | One failure = cancel service |
| **Decision Making** | Committee, procurement | Owner/CEO decides fast |

### What SMBs Actually Want

1. **"Just make it work"** - No learning curve, no implementation projects
2. **Someone to call** - Not a chatbot, not a ticket system
3. **Visible ROI** - "This agent saved us X hours/week"
4. **Guardrails** - "Don't let AI do something stupid with our data"
5. **Grows with us** - Start small, add capabilities over time

### MSP Pricing Models (Analogy)

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Per-User** | Flat fee per employee (e.g., $50-150/user/month) |
| **Tiered Bundles** | Bronze/Silver/Gold packages |
| **All-Inclusive** | One flat monthly fee for everything |
| **Monitoring-Only** | Basic oversight, charge for remediation |
| **A La Carte** | Individual services priced separately |

### Fractional CTO Pricing (Similar Service Model)

- **Standard:** $6,500 - $10,000/month
- **Premium/AI-Specialized:** $10,000 - $20,000/month

**Key Insight:** "Fractional AI Officer" or "Fractional Agent Manager" is an untapped positioning.

- **Quote:** "We have hundreds of agents doing real work, every day" (referring to AI agents as virtual workforce)

### Key MIP Services

1. **AI-Driven Predictive Monitoring** - Pattern recognition, anomaly detection
2. **Self-Fixing Systems** - Automated remediation playbooks
3. **Intelligent Automation** - Patching, backups, scaling, routine tasks

## 5. Ferdi's Service Offering: "Agent Manager as a Service"

### The Value Proposition

**For a 10-50 person company:**

| **Agent Support** | When things break or need adjustment | Response within 24h |
| **Agent Expansion** | Add new capabilities as needs grow | Quarterly reviews |

### Target Use Cases for SMBs

### Suggested Pricing Model

**Tiered Retainer + Usage:**

| Tier | Monthly | Includes | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Starter** | €1,500/mo | 1-2 agents, basic monitoring, email support | Testing the waters |
| **Growth** | €3,500/mo | 3-5 agents, full governance, priority support, quarterly strategy | Committed SMBs |

- **API/Token Passthrough:** At cost + 15% margin
- **Custom Agent Development:** €1,500 - €5,000 per agent (project-based)

### Pricing Rationale

- **€1,500/mo Starter** = Less than one day/week of an employee's time
- **€3,500/mo Growth** = Cost of Copilot for 15-20 users, but fully managed
- **€7,500/mo Scale** = Fraction of a junior hire, more capability

### Deliverables Per Tier

**Monthly Deliverables:**
- Agent performance dashboard (uptime, usage, errors)

## 6. Go-to-Market Considerations

### Positioning Options

| Angle | Messaging |
|-------|-----------|
| **Fractional AI Officer** | "Your AI strategy and ops team, part-time" |
| **Agent Operations** | "We run your AI agents so you don't have to" |
| **AI Managed Services** | "MSP for artificial intelligence" |
| **Business Automation Partner** | "Automation that actually works" |

### Target Verticals (High-Impact for SMBs)

1. **Professional Services** (law, accounting, consulting) - Document-heavy, time-sensitive
2. **Real Estate** - Lead qualification, scheduling, follow-up automation
3. **Healthcare Clinics** - Appointment scheduling, patient comms, intake
4. **E-commerce/Retail** - Customer support, inventory insights
5. **Agencies** (marketing, design) - Client communication, project coordination

### Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Weakness | Your Advantage |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| DIY Tools (ChatGPT, etc.) | No integration, no oversight | Full-service management |
| AI Consultants | Project-based, no ongoing support | Continuous relationship |
| Enterprise Platforms | Too expensive, too complex | Right-sized for SMB |
| Traditional MSPs | AI is afterthought | AI-first expertise |
| Offshore Dev Shops | Quality/communication issues | Local, personal service |

## 7. Key Takeaways

1. **The market exists but is fragmented** - No clear leader in managed AI agents for SMBs
2. **SMBs want outcomes, not tools** - They'll pay for results, not technology
3. **Retainer + usage hybrid is the sweet spot** - Predictable revenue + upside alignment
4. **The "MIP" framing is emerging** - Ride this wave early
5. **Fractional positioning works** - Proven model from CTO/CMO space translates
6. **Trust is the differentiator** - SMBs need someone they can call, who knows their business

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Define 2-3 productized agent packages** (e.g., "Customer Support Agent," "Lead Qualifier Agent")
2. **Create a simple ROI calculator** showing hourly savings vs. service cost
3. **Build one case study** demonstrating measurable results
4. **Target one vertical** initially to build expertise and referrals
5. **Partner with existing MSPs** who want to offer AI but lack capability (white-label opportunity)
