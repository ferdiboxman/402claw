## Features Section

### Old Copy
- "Built for autonomous agents"
- "Traditional APIs require accounts..."

### New Copy

**"Two ways to monetize"**

| Data APIs | Skills |
|-----------|--------|
| CSV, JSON → instant endpoint | SKILL.md → paid invocations |
| Price per request | Price per judgment |
| Serve information | Serve expertise |

**"The API era is over. The Skill era is here."**

In the API era, you owned pipes (payments, messaging, email).
In the skill era, you own patterns (how to price, how to position, how to close).

Clawr lets you monetize both.

## Positioning Statement

**For agent builders** who need quality data and expert skills,
**Clawr** is the monetization layer
**that** lets anyone deploy paid APIs and skills with one command.
**Unlike** traditional API marketplaces that require accounts and subscriptions,
**Clawr** uses x402 micropayments—call, pay, receive. Zero friction.
