# The Skill Era Manifesto

The API era is over.

For fifteen years, the game was simple: own a pipe, charge for throughput. Stripe moved money. Twilio moved messages. They built infrastructure between intention and execution.

Then LLMs compressed execution into prompts.

Suddenly, capability isn't scarce. Any agent can spin up infrastructure on demand. What's scarce is *judgment*—knowing what to do, not just being able to do it.

**Welcome to the skill era.**

Skills are packaged expertise. The playbook that took you years to develop, encoded so agents can invoke it. The pricing framework that runs 10,000 times a day. The audit that scales while you sleep.

In the API era, you owned pipes.
In the skill era, you own patterns.

The addressable market is no longer developers with engineering teams. It's *everyone with expertise*. The marketer who writes headlines that convert. The accountant who knows exactly how to structure a deal. The recruiter who spots what separates good from great.

All of them can turn knowledge into callable, payable, scalable infrastructure.

**One command. Set a price. Get paid per invocation.**

No accounts. No API keys. No subscriptions. Just value flowing both ways.

The API era created companies worth tens of billions. The skill era will create a generation of individuals and companies who own the patterns agents need.

The question isn't whether this shift is happening.
It's whether you'll be charging for skills or paying for them.

*Skills are the new APIs. Expertise is the new infrastructure. This is Clawr.*
