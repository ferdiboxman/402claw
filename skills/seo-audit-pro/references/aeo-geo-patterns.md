# AEO & GEO Content Patterns

Patterns for optimizing content to be cited by AI answer engines (AEO) and generative search (GEO).

## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

### Structure for AI Citation
- Lead with a direct, concise answer in the first 1-2 sentences
- Follow with supporting evidence and detail
- Use clear headings that match common questions
- Include structured data (schema markup)

### Content Patterns
- **Definition blocks**: "X is [clear definition]."
- **Comparison tables**: Side-by-side feature/attribute comparisons
- **Step-by-step lists**: Numbered, actionable steps
- **FAQ sections**: Question-answer pairs with schema

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

### What Gets Cited
- Unique data and statistics
- Expert quotes and opinions
- Specific, verifiable claims
- Clear, authoritative explanations

### What Gets Skipped
- Generic filler content
- Rehashed common knowledge
- Vague, unsupported claims
- Content that reads like every other result

## Application to SEO Audits

When writing audit recommendations:
- Be specific: "Change title from X to Y" not "Optimize your title"
- Include numbers: "Save 1.2s by converting to WebP"
- Provide evidence: "Your LCP is 3.4s (poor)" not "Your page is slow"
