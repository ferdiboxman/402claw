# AI Writing Detection — Patterns to Avoid

When generating SEO content or audit reports, avoid these common AI writing tells:

## Overused Phrases
- "In today's digital landscape"
- "It's worth noting that"
- "Dive deep into"
- "Leverage" (use "use")
- "Utilize" (use "use")
- "Robust" (be specific)
- "Cutting-edge" (be specific)
- "Game-changer"
- "Seamlessly"

## Structural Tells
- Every paragraph exactly 3 sentences
- Lists always exactly 5 items
- Overly symmetrical structure
- Em dashes overuse (—)
- Starting every section with "When it comes to..."

## Better Approach
- Vary sentence and paragraph length
- Use specific numbers and data
- Write like you're explaining to a colleague
- Include occasional short, punchy sentences
- Reference real examples
